      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>Nation Infinity Africa is a foundation that was started on 27th december 2020 , the dream was vissioned by Katende Ibrahim who was 18 years of age by that time . He was born in a rich and successful family, they lacked nothing because his father provided everthing at home, allover a sudden all his pleasures and happiness endeed the day his father passed on when he was five years of age and death of his father left his mother wondering of how how life will be , who had no job. To make matters worse, He was to inherit all his fathers wealth and riches which his Father had left , but the greediness of the brothers and sisters of his father didnt allow this to happen , forcefully they grabed everything and left them with totally nothing not even a start of life , they became a community shame (from riches to poverty), not untill his mother got an idea to start tailoring clothes and got a machine, which enabled them to generate income for a living When he was growing up he desired to start a dance crew known as nation infinity dance crew and when he was 18 years old he made his dream true and started it with five kids who came for training in the morning and departed in the evening to their home after training, but when COVI19 virus worsened in our country it changed it all , many children ended up being victims of drug abuse, prostitution was the order of the day to young girls , wereby they sold their bodies to men inorder to generate money .When he saw this happening, he was heart touched and thought of how the next generation will be, he then planned of how he can reduce on the cause of these victims, much sympathy and generosity forced him to construct a wooden and polthyene roofed house, for accommodation and this inflicated a start of pure determined and compasionate heart with pure mind to achieve big dreams , he then risked and lived with over 158 children who are pure orphans with no parents were he had constructed a home , at her mothers place. Many challeges came across but the dream of beating the wolrld record never stopped raininig in our hearts , for real nobody expecpected he could build hope in these children through the programmes he introduced to them. For the local leardes started qouting his charity claiming that he is doing all this inorder to get sysmpathy to the community hence targeting to join the political race , so life was not that easy to survive but we belived that it has been God's grace that we are still existing.</p>
